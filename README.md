# FEM-Teaching-Material
Introductory Course on Finite Element Method.
This REPO contains teaching material for an introductory course on Finite Element Analysis. This is just preliminary work. The REPO contains two main folder namely;

**NOTEBOOKS:** Source files for the course notebooks. Better visualized from nbviewer following the links below.

**CLASS NOTES:** Latex files for the set of class notes.
